## Purpose and evidence rule

This living report demonstrates that the system satisfies its timing requirements.
The required argument is:

`requirement -> task -> analysis -> measured evidence -> verdict`

Every timing claim shall cite an evidence ID. A result without its platform,
firmware revision, configuration, load, instrument, and observation interval is not
accepted as timing evidence.

## 1. The system and its task set

### 1.1 Scope

SoilSense Control is a Zephyr-based irrigation controller. It contains periodic
sensing and control activities, an overpressure safety response, telemetry, a
command console, and an optional display. SoilSense Hub, introduced in week 10 and
developed as the final project, adds PREEMPT_RT Linux, a local GUI, routing, and a
hard pump-station loop.

Sources:

- `PROJECT_SCENARIO.md` — product context and reference requirements.
- `firmware/superloop/` — initial implementation to be measured.
- `READINGS.md` — analysis methods and course scope.

### 1.2 Timing requirements

The requirements below are initial engineering requirements. Values marked `TBD`
must be fixed before the corresponding verification; they must not be inferred from
successful runs.

| ID | Requirement (EARS style) | Type | Status | Planned verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-CTRL-01 | While the system is irrigating, the control loop shall be released every 10 ms and shall complete no later than its next release. | Hard | Draft | GPIO + logic analyzer; RTA |
| REQ-CTRL-02 | When measured pressure exceeds the safety threshold, the system shall command the valve/pump to its safe state within 5 ms. | Hard | Draft | Instrumented input-to-output latency |
| REQ-CTRL-03 | While control is enabled, the system shall sample the pressure input every 1 ms and shall complete each sampling job before its next release. | Hard | Measured — FAIL in current superloop | GPIO + logic analyzer |
| REQ-CTRL-04 | While the control node is operational, the system shall publish telemetry of its current state at least once every 1000 ms. | Soft | Observed; detailed deadline analysis pending | GPIO + logic analyzer |
| REQ-CTRL-05 | When a valid console command is received, the system shall produce a usable response within `TBD`; a response after that limit may be discarded. | Firm | Incomplete | UART timestamps + trace |
| REQ-CTRL-06 | While a firm console command is executing, the system shall continue to satisfy all hard sampling deadlines. | Hard | Measured — FAIL in current superloop | GPIO + logic analyzer + serial status |

### 1.3 Task set

`C_i` is the execution time of task `i`. It remains `____` until it is measured
under a declared protocol. A future maximum observed value will be reported as
`C_obs,max`; it shall not be called WCET without a justified upper-bound method.

| Task | Requirement | Type | Activation/period | Deadline | Measured `C_i` | Jitter bound | Priority/policy | Measurement method |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| Sensor sampling | REQ-CTRL-03 | Hard | Periodic, 1 ms (1 kHz) | 1 ms | `C_obs,max` 3 us baseline; 4 us cache-off; 12 us during `calib` | 5.845 ms normal; 413.06 ms during `calib` | Single superloop | GPIO + analyzer |
| Control loop | REQ-CTRL-01 | Hard | Periodic, 10 ms | 10 ms | ____ | TBD | TBD | GPIO + analyzer |
| Overpressure emergency stop | REQ-CTRL-02 | Hard | Event-triggered | < 5 ms | Shared with sampling; standalone response not measured | N/A | TBD | Instrumented input-to-output latency |
| Command console | REQ-CTRL-05, REQ-CTRL-06 | Firm | Event-triggered/sporadic | TBD | `calib` blocks the loop for approximately 414 ms; not a WCET | N/A | Single superloop | UART + DIO2 trace |
| Telemetry | REQ-CTRL-04 | Soft | Periodic, 1 s | 1 s (derived from task period) | Not separately exported | TBD | Single superloop | DIO3 trace |
| Flow batch | N/A | N/A | Every 100 flow pulses | TBD | Not separately quantified | N/A | Single superloop | DIO4 trace |
| Display HMI | N/A | Soft | Periodic, 500 ms when enabled | TBD | Not enabled on this run | N/A | Single superloop | DIO5 trace |

No execution time, telemetry period, console deadline, sensor deadline, or jitter
bound has been invented; each unresolved value remains explicit until the course
provides it or the team measures and justifies it.

### 1.4 Initial traceability matrix

| Requirement | Implementing task | Analysis | Evidence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-CTRL-01 | Control loop | Utilization + RTA | Pending week 2 | PENDING |
| REQ-CTRL-02 | Overpressure emergency stop | Input-to-output response bound | Pending measurement | PENDING |
| REQ-CTRL-03 | Sensor sampling | Period/jitter analysis | EV-W02-BASELINE-002, EV-W02-CACHE-004, EV-W02-BLOCK-005 | FAIL |
| REQ-CTRL-04 | Telemetry | Period characterization | DIO3 visible in Week 2 captures; detailed statistic pending | INCONCLUSIVE |
| REQ-CTRL-05 | Command console | Response-time characterization | EV-W02-BLOCK-005; deadline is TBD | INCONCLUSIVE |
| REQ-CTRL-06 | Console versus hard sampling | Non-interference trace | EV-W02-BLOCK-005 | FAIL |

## 2. Architecture Decision Records

No architecture decision is accepted before its alternatives and timing evidence
exist.

### ADR-001 — Control-node execution architecture

- **Status:** Not started; decision due in week 4.
- **Context:** Compare the superloop and multithreaded Zephyr implementation on the
  same ESP32-S3, with the same task set and load.
- **Alternatives:** superloop; multithreaded kernel; hybrid architecture.
- **Decision:** TBD.
- **Quantitative justification:** Week 2 measured a 6.845 ms maximum sampling
  period against a 1 ms deadline in normal operation and 414.06 ms during the
  blocking console command. The kernel comparison remains due in weeks 3–4.
- **Consequences and costs:** TBD.

### ADR-002 — Mutual-exclusion policy

- **Status:** Not started; decision due in week 7.
- **Decision:** TBD after measuring blocking and priority inversion.

### ADR-003 — Core allocation for the hard loop

- **Status:** Not started; decision due in week 9.
- **Decision:** TBD after comparing one-core load with AMP isolation.

### ADR-004 — Hub real-time configuration

- **Status:** Not started; decision due in week 12.
- **Decision:** TBD after PREEMPT_RT, CPU affinity, IRQ, and interference tests.

### 3.3 Week 2 — provided superloop

#### Measurement conditions

- Board: NUCLEO-G474RE; instrumentation overlay maps D3–D8 to task GPIOs.
- Analyzer: Analog Discovery 2 with WaveForms 3.25.1 Logic; record mode,
  30,000,000 samples at 1 MHz for 30 s (1 us sample resolution).
- Normal baseline workload: no console command and Pattern generator stopped.
- Cache-off run: same source, pins, clock, analyzer configuration, and workload;
  only ART instruction/data caches and Flash prefetch were disabled.
- Blocking run: cache-on firmware, identical capture settings, one `calib`
  command issued through ST-LINK VCP at 115200 8N1.

#### Timing results

| Measurement | Cache ON baseline | Cache OFF | During `calib` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Sampling mean period | 1.0001 ms | 1.0001 ms | 1.0001 ms |
| Sampling minimum period | 6 us | 7 us | 6 us |
| Sampling maximum period | 6.845 ms | 6.857 ms | 414.06 ms |
| Sampling maximum absolute jitter | 5.845 ms | 5.857 ms | 413.06 ms |
| Sampling mean pulse width | 2.4886 us | 3.3888 us | 2.5071 us |
| Sampling maximum pulse width | 3 us | 4 us | 12 us |
| `backlog_peak` | 6 | Not separately queried | 414 |

The cache-on superloop fails REQ-CTRL-03: its 6.845 ms maximum period is
5.845 ms beyond the 1 ms deadline even before the explicit blocking command.
The `calib` command makes the failure approximately 71 times larger in maximum
jitter (413.06 ms versus 5.845 ms) and raises `backlog_peak` from 6 to 414.
The analyzer and firmware agree because 414 pending 1 ms ticks correspond to
about 414 ms. Cache-off increased mean observed sampling execution time by 36.2%,
but changed the dominant jitter only 12 us; the synchronous loop blocking is the
main cause.

#### Flow hand-off characterization

AD2 DIO6 drove Nucleo D9/PC7 at 100 Hz and DIO4 observed flow-batch work. For
one selected 100th-pulse event, service began about 6 us after the DIO6 rising
edge. This is a characterized observed latency, not a guarantee, because no
flow-service deadline is allocated yet.

#### Evidence and limitations

See `evidence/week02/README.md` and the five evidence records cited above.
The preserved artifacts are WaveForms screenshots; no transition-data export or
workspace was retained. Results therefore support the shown statistics and
verdicts, but do not constitute a formal WCET proof.

### 3.4 Future-week evidence rule

Each new measurement record must state:

1. objective and linked requirements;
2. board and serial/nickname;
3. firmware Git commit and configuration;
4. workload and environmental conditions;
5. instrument, resolution, and connections;
6. observation interval and sample count;
7. min/mean/p99/max or another justified statistic;
8. explicit `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `INCONCLUSIVE` verdict and deadline margin;
9. paths to raw data, scripts, and figures.

## 4. Schedulability analysis

### 4.1 Input data

All `C_i` inputs shall cite measured evidence and the configuration under which
they were obtained.
