# Week-4 talk — IPC: message queues, workqueues, ISR deferral (40 min)

**Precedes:** `labs/lab04_ipc.md` · **Audience:** students right before the lab.

## Objectives
By the end, the student can: 1. pick the right kernel primitive for each superloop
pattern; 2. explain the short-ISR + deferral discipline; 3. read an A/B table by
maxima, not averages.

## Structure
| Min | Segment | Purpose in one line |
|---|---|---|
| 0–5 | Hook: Samuel defends the A/B to Gustavo | the table decides the architecture |
| 5–18 | The full mapping table | every superloop piece → its kernel counterpart |
| 18–28 | ISR deferral discipline | why ISRs must be short and where the work goes |
| 28–33 | Reading an A/B | maxima move, averages barely do |
| 33–37 | What about FreeRTOS? | 1:1 mapping, different defaults |
| 37–40 | Bridge to the lab | protocol symmetry or the table lies |

## Segment 1 — The full mapping table
- Key idea: migration is a table, not an art form (it's printed in the lab guide):
  ISR flag + loop check → short ISR + `k_msgq`/`k_sem`; heavy polled work → thread
  with its own priority; improvised bottom half → `k_work`; blocking console →
  low-priority thread. Each row removes one coupling the superloop forced.
- **Board sketch:** the table, filled row by row with the class naming the
  counterpart before it's written.
- **Question for the room:** which row kills the blocking-command problem, and why
  doesn't the console need to be *fixed* — just deprioritized?

## Segment 2 — ISR deferral discipline
- Key idea: interrupt context blocks everything above it — work done there is
  latency charged to *every* task. Rule: ISR captures and hands off (µs), a thread
  or `k_work` processes. The workqueue is a shared thread: convenient, but its
  queue is FIFO — heavy items delay light ones (own thread if it matters).
- **Board sketch:** timeline of a long ISR stretching every task's latency vs. the
  short-ISR + hand-off version.

> **Misconception to anticipate:** "threads make the system faster." They don't —
> context switches cost. What they buy is that the worst case stops depending on
> unrelated code. The A/B shows the average nearly tied and the max transformed.

## Segment 3 — Reading an A/B
- Key idea: same tasks, same board, same protocol, one variable (the architecture).
  Compare maxima: Samuel's question is the worst case. And report the cost too
  (switch overhead) — an ADR that hides the cost isn't credible to Gustavo.

## What about FreeRTOS?
`k_msgq` → `xQueue`, `k_sem` → semaphores, `k_work` → the timer-daemon task or a
dedicated worker. Same discipline, same table. The real difference is defaults:
FreeRTOS boots minimal (its strength on small chips); Zephyr ships console/log/shell
ready (its strength in bigger products).

## Bridge to the lab
Finish the migration, keep the *same* instrumentation GPIOs, repeat the week-2
protocol exactly. Expected shape: averages ≈ tied, max jitter under the blocking
command collapses from ms to µs — that number is ADR-001's justification.
