# Week-3 talk — The scheduler: threads, priorities, preemption (40 min)

**Precedes:** `labs/lab03_port.md` · **Audience:** students right before the lab.

## Objectives
By the end, the student can: 1. explain what a devicetree overlay buys in a port;
2. describe the RT-kernel anatomy (thread states, ready queue, context switch);
3. map the superloop's polled sampling to a thread + message queue.

## Structure
| Min | Segment | Purpose in one line |
|---|---|---|
| 0–5 | Hook: two pieces of news | production picked the S3; the kernel evaluation is authorized |
| 5–15 | The port: hardware as data | devicetree/overlay — why the C doesn't change |
| 15–27 | Anatomy of an RT kernel | states, ready queue, preemption, switch cost (§10.1–10.3) |
| 27–33 | The first mapping | polled sampling → thread + `k_msgq` |
| 33–37 | What about FreeRTOS? | same scheduler model, no devicetree |
| 37–40 | Bridge to the lab | the diff-stat and the new jitter |

## Segment 1 — The port: hardware as data
- The idea: the application names hardware by *role*; a separate description
  binds the role to pins. Vocabulary on the board, one line each:
  - **Node**: a device in the tree (`&adc1`, an LED).
  - **Property**: its facts (`gpios = <&gpioa 1 ...>`).
  - **Binding**: the schema saying what properties a `solomon,ssd1306fb` needs.
  - **Alias / chosen**: role names (`led0`, `zephyr,console`) the app looks up.
  - **Overlay**: a patch on the board's tree — *this* is the port.
- In Zephyr the tree is compiled: `DEVICE_DT_GET(...)` resolves at build time,
  costs zero RAM at runtime (unlike Linux, where the same idea — same syntax,
  they'll see it again in week 10's SBC — is parsed at boot).
- Today's proof: `firmware/superloop/boards/*.overlay` — instrumentation pins and
  ADC channels move from C0 pins to S3 pins; `main.c` diff: **zero lines**.
- **Board sketch:** one `main.c` box fed by two small DT files (C0116-DK pins /
  S3 pins); arrow labels "port = data, not code".
- **Question for the room:** week 1's toolchain map said vendor SDKs embed
  FreeRTOS — what does *this* port cost there? (SDK change; the FreeRTOS segment
  closes the loop.)

## Segment 2 — Anatomy of an RT kernel
- What a kernel fundamentally adds (Buttazzo §10.1–10.3): the CPU stops being
  "whatever the loop reaches next" and becomes a *managed resource*.
- **A thread is**: a stack + saved registers + a TCB (priority, state). Nothing
  mystical — the superloop had one implicit thread; now there are several, each
  owning its own "where was I".
- **States**, drawn as the lifecycle diagram: *ready* (wants CPU), *running*
  (has it), *blocked/pending* (waiting on time or data — costs zero CPU). The
  superloop's crime in this language: it has no *blocked* state — everything is
  always "running", burning passes polling flags.
- **The scheduler's one rule**: the highest-priority *ready* thread runs.
  Always. Enforced at every **preemption point**: an ISR ends, a mutex unlocks,
  a sleep expires. "Immediately" replaces "when the loop comes around" — link 4
  of last week's chain gets a new, bounded name.
- **The context switch**: save registers to the old stack, restore from the new
  (on Cortex-M this rides the PendSV exception — Yiu ch. 10 shows the exact
  sequence). Cost: on the order of a µs — measured, not believed, in week 4's
  Task C.
- **Priorities in Zephyr**: lower number = more important; negative priorities
  are *cooperative* (won't be preempted — the course leaves them alone until the
  tracing week shows one).
- **Board sketch:** the three-state diagram; next to it, last week's five-link
  chain with link 4 crossed out and replaced by "preempt: bounded by switch cost".
- **Question for the room:** what should the blocking `calib` command do to a
  *higher-priority* sampling thread? (Nothing — that's this afternoon's
  measurement. Let them commit to the prediction out loud.)

> **Misconception to anticipate:** "the kernel adds overhead, so it's slower."
> Slower on average by µs of switching — but the *worst case* stops depending on
> the longest loop body. The A/B in week 4 shows both effects in one table.

## Segment 3 — The first mapping
- Migration is mechanical, one piece at a time — today only sampling:
  - `K_THREAD_DEFINE(sample_tid, STACK, sample_fn, ..., PRIO, 0, 0)` — the
    polled work becomes a thread that *sleeps* on a timer.
  - The ISR stops setting a flag and posts to a **`k_msgq`**; the thread blocks
    on `k_msgq_get` — the hand-off wait becomes a wake-up.
- Everything else stays superloop. Mixed systems are normal mid-migration — that
  is *how* real products migrate.
- **Board sketch:** first row of the mapping table (flag+poll → ISR+`k_msgq`+
  thread). The full table is week 4's talk.

## What about FreeRTOS?
`xTaskCreate` ↔ `K_THREAD_DEFINE`, `xQueueSend/Receive` ↔ `k_msgq_put/get` —
same preemptive fixed-priority model, near-1:1 API (one habit flip: FreeRTOS
priorities go *up*, Zephyr's go down). What has no equivalent is Segment 1:
moving STM32 → ESP32 under FreeRTOS means changing vendor SDKs, not a 20-line
overlay.

## Bridge to the lab
Two numbers to predict before touching anything: the port's `git diff --stat`
(expect ~0 lines of C) and the S3's baseline jitter (expect *worse* than the
M0+ — external flash behind a cache; write down why before measuring).
