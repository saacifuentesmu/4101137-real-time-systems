# Week 9 — A devicetree driver and the two cores (AMP)
> **Tech guide:** SOP-09 *(pending: sysbuild/AMP)* · **Reading:** [LECTURAS.md](../LECTURAS.md), week 9 · **Module:** 4
> **Due today:** Problem Set 2.

**From:** Eng. Samuel Cifuentes — *"Two assignments. One: the flow sensor deserves
a real driver, with its binding — not a loose `gpio_get` in the app. Two: the S3
has two cores and we're using one; I want to know whether the second core can buy
the control loop a better **worst case**. Today's talk also owes you an honest
answer: when FreeRTOS is the right call — because some customer will demand it."*

| Stakeholder | Their question | How this session answers it |
|---|---|---|
| **Samuel** | Does the second core improve the tail of the distribution? | Max jitter with and without a dedicated core |
| **Edwin** | Does the sensor survive a board change? | The driver lives behind the binding, not in the app |

## What you'll measure

| Measurement | Your value | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Max loop jitter, 1 core, no load | ____ µs | reference (wk 4) |
| Max loop jitter, 1 core, **with synthetic load** | ____ µs | the load: a cache-thrashing thread |
| Max loop jitter on APPCPU, load on PROCPU | ____ µs | partitioned isolation |
| Averages of all three cases | ____ | hint: they barely move — the tail does |

## Tasks

### Task A — The driver with a binding
- Turn the YF-S401 reading into a minimal Zephyr driver: its own devicetree
  binding (`vendor,yf-s401`), sensor API, the app consumes it via `DEVICE_DT_GET`.
- **Evidence:** the node working as before, but with the sensor declared in the
  overlay and not a single hard-coded pin in the app.

### Task B — AMP with sysbuild
- Two images (SOP-09): the **hard loop** (with its instrumentation GPIO) for
  `esp32s3_devkitc/esp32s3/appcpu`; the rest of the node + a **synthetic load**
  for `.../procpu`. No console on the APPCPU (a real limitation — `ets_printf` if
  you must debug): measurement is by GPIO, as always.
- **Evidence:** both images running at once, loop toggle visible.

### Task C — The tail of the distribution
- Usual protocol, ≥ 60 s per case, fill in the table. Compare **maxima**, not
  averages: the talk's thesis is that partitioning doesn't improve the typical
  case — it cuts off the rare spikes.
- **Evidence:** table + the three captures.

## What about FreeRTOS?

Here FreeRTOS wins on this board: ESP-IDF ships real SMP on the S3 (a global
scheduler across both cores, with optional per-task pinning), while Zephyr's
Xtensa port still has no SMP — today we work around it with AMP. The honest
criterion: if your product is "this S3, radio on, both cores squeezed",
ESP-IDF/FreeRTOS is the mature option; if it's "a product family across varied
silicon", Zephyr.

## Deliverables (RET)

- **§3 Week-9 evidence:** the three-case table + a one-sentence reading.
- **§2 ADR-003 — Does the hard loop live on its own core?** Decision backed by the
  tail numbers; include the cost (two images, no console on APPCPU).

## Rubric (100 pts)

| | pts |
|---|---|
| **Execution** — clean driver with binding (20) · AMP running (20) | 40 |
| **Evidence** — three-case table with a constant protocol (20) · captures (10) | 30 |
| **Analysis** — maxima vs. averages well read (15) · ADR-003 with the cost acknowledged (15) | 30 |
